Today I learned how to self-host the automation software n8n on a Zimaboard with CasaOS installed.

1. **Access Your Zimaboard:** Open your web browser and navigate to your casaos dashboard via casaos.local.
2. **Log In to CasaOS:** Enter your credentials to log in to the CasaOS dashboard.
3. **Install n8n:** Go to the app store within CasaOS and search for "n8n". Click on the "Install" button.
4. **Configure n8n:** After installation, set up n8n by entering your n8n account API key that can be made from your n8n official website account dashboard.
5. **Launch n8n:** Once configured, launch n8n from the CasaOS app dashboard to start using it locally on your device.

Now you can enjoy running n8n on your Zimaboard with full functionality!
